more specific = higher priority

    inline  ->   # id  ->   .class  ->  type    ->  * (universal selector)

more selectors = more specific


inheritance:
    direct rules > inherited rules


If two rules have equal specificity, the last one written in the CSS file wins.


=======================================================================


Specificity = (a, b, c, d)
    Where:

    a = inline styles (e.g., style="") â†’ usually 0 or 1

    b = number of ID selectors

    c = number of class, attribute, or pseudo-class selectors

    d = number of type or pseudo-element selectors
